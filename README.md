Crypto Comrade!
===============

This repository is meant to accompany the blog post **"cryptocomrade: Cryptography in Golang"**:
https://sphinx.rs/blog/golang_cryptography/

It is meant to be a handy set of examples that are useful
for writing cryptography applications in Golang.

It's a work in progress. I will add more content.

I'm also working on Rust cryptography code examples and blog post as well.
